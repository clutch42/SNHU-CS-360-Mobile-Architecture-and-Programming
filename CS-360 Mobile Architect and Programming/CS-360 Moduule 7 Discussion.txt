Hi everyone. I am going to discuss Candy Crush, one of the most successful mobile game app ever made. I've seen a bunch of varring figures on how much it's made, but the lowest is $7.5 billion, which is incredible for a game that is initially free. I also found some infomation that say that 97.7% of people that play it don't ever make an in app purchase, so that means all that money came from 2.3% of the player base. Anyways, the developement process was pretty much designed to create a game to make money. It really doesn't serve any other purpose than to kill time and annoy your friends with requests for lives. The design to encourage user engagement is pretty brilliant. It has very addictive gameplay - all the colors and sounds are supposed to remind you of a casino which is designed to keep you playing. There are increasing levels of difficulty, so you don't get bored. You can connect through Facebook to get lives from friends, they introduce new material, and there are rewards for playing and doing good. The way they make money is in-app purchases, like lives, boosters and additional moves. The design elements that encourge these purchases are limiting lives and making people wait to get more. If your trying to kill time in the first place you aren't going to wait. The boosters and additional moves can be used to get past levels that are giving you trouble. They also have incentives for purchases, like exclusive items, limit-time promotions, and discounts. I love the idea of getting a discount on a fake currency that they can make as much of as they want. While they do a lot of marketing, they also have you do it for free, by attaching your Facebook to it for the chance of more lives. There is an episode of South Park that is actually really on topic for this weeks discussion and readings, "Freemium Isn't Free."
