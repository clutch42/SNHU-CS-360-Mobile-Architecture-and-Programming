# CS-360-Mobile-Architect-Programming
## Course Description
Students will apply mobile development principles and best practices to develop mobile 
applications using user-centered design principles and industry standards. Upon completion of 
a fully-functional mobile application, students will conduct security, product assuredness, and 
compatibility checks before launching the application.
## Course Competencies
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills 
relevant to your field:
- CS-30421: Apply mobile application development principles and best practices in the development of a mobile application
- CS-30422: Apply user-centered design principles and industry standards in the development of a mobile application
- CS-30423: Develop and launch a fully functional mobile application

## Projects
### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? 
The requirement for the app that I developed were to create a weight tracking app with a login, ability to add, update, and delete a daily weight, add and update a target weight, and send a sms message if the target weight is reached if the permission is granted, otherwise just let the user know in app. This is meant to help a user track and compare their weight to a target.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? 
I ended up with more layouts than I thought i would for such a simple app, but I feel all of them where necessary to make it easy to read and navigate. I think the design I implemented is easy on the eyes, easy to hit the buttons, and easy to navigate, which are all important for the user experience.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future? 
I like the strategy that we used for this project. The usual design phase, then we actually put together all of the UI's, and then programmed the guts to make it work. Usually I would work on one page at a time until it was finished, but i really liked doing it this way.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal? 
I continuously tested my code in the device emulator. Without continuous testing, especially on something that I am learning, I would have no idea if it worked or where the bugs were.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge? 
My biggest challenge in probably in the UI design. I am much more concerned with functionality than appearance, but I think I actually did a good job of considering the appearance and keeping the app as clean looking as I could.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? 
I think that implementing the SMS message into my app was the part that I am most proud of. After I downloaded it to my phone in developer mode with my phone number in the code and it actually sent me a text message was a great feeling.
